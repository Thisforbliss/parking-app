Welcome,<br>
Thank you for signing up for Washington heights Parking APP!<br>
<br><br>
This app is a community of drivers who collaborate together to notify each other when we're about to leave a spot so we dont have to aimlessly search for one.<br>
Yesss, we know how much you hate it as much as we do!<br>
So lets get started by filling out content to help people know what type of car you have, where you parked it as well as the location.<br>
Wtih this information, we'll put it into a forum so drivers searching the forum could get your info and take your spot when you leave.<br>
That simple,<br>
Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
