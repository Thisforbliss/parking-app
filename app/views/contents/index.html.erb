<strong>Welcome,
 <!-- I want the user to be greeted by their username -->

Thank you for signing up for Washington heights Parking APP!</strong><br>
<br><br>
This app is a community of drivers who collaborate together to notify each other when we're about to leave a spot so we dont have to aimlessly search for one.<br>
Yesss, we know how much you hate it as much as we do!<br>
Below are all drivers you can connect with to share spots and if you'll like to add content, click the button at the bottom of the page to get started.<br>

<a href='contents/new'><button>Click here to add a new spot</button><br><br><br>


  <strong><%Content.all.each do |instance|%>
  <%=instance.car_location%><br>
    <%=instance.license_plate%><br>
      <%=instance.car_model%>
  <%end%></strong>
